# Explorer
Explorer is a simple Jekyll theme for blogging. This is the setup I use for my own [blog](https://storyexplorer.blog/).

You can use this repo by forking or by using the template button to get started right away.

Since this is based on the [Reverie theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), please check that readme for more instructions. 

## Additions to Reverie
- The main thing I've added is an option to embed a Discord server using [WidgetBot](https://widgetbot.io/) to handle commenting on posts. Here, I have it set up to go to WidgetBot's welcome channel on their example server. You can check how this works in the [post.html layout file]([https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/blob/main/_layouts/post.html](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/blob/8d0af43fa4f247166d66621ad95768b34be5963e/_layouts/post.html#L30-L45)). If you want to do commenting based on threads instead of channels, there's an [option in the header of post markdown](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/blob/8d0af43fa4f247166d66621ad95768b34be5963e/_posts/2023-12-18-example-post-1.md?plain=1#L5) files where you can add the thread ID that you want to display. To enable this, go to [post.html](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/blob/8d0af43fa4f247166d66621ad95768b34be5963e/_layouts/post.html#L30-L45) and add the thread attribute as explained there.
