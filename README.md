# Explorer
Explorer is a simple Jekyll theme for blogging. This is the setup I use for my own [blog](https://storyexplorer.blog/).

You can use this repo by forking or by using the template button to get started right away.

Since this is based on the [Reverie theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), please check that readme for more instructions. 

## Additions to Reverie
- The main thing I've added is an option to embed a Discord server using [WidgetBot](https://widgetbot.io/) to handle commenting on posts. Here, I have it set up to go to WidgetBot's welcome channel on their example server. You can check how this works in the post.html layout file. If you want to do commenting based on threads instead of channels, there's an option in the header of post markdown files where you can add the thread ID that you want to display. To enable this, go to post.html and add the thread attribute as explained there. 
- Vollkorn font and other style updates for my blog
- Footer with site page links and copyright statement
