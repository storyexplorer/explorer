This Jekyll theme is based on [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie). I used Reverie to build [my own blog](https://storyexplorer.blog/) and loved its simplicity. I made this theme to make it a bit easier to share the structure of my blog. This way anyone who wants to use the structure can do so without worrying about having to delete all my content. 

Hope you enjoy!
